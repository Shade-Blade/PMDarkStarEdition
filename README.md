# PMDarkStarEdition
**Paper Mario: Dark Star Edition** is a mod for Paper Mario created by **ShadeBlade** that adds a lot of new content to the game and increases the difficulty.
Some of the content was taken from Master Quest, but most of it is entirely new.
This mod is meant to be about as difficult as Master Quest Jr, but there are badges that increase the health and damage of enemies.
Thanks to bossbuzz for drawing the partner intro image.

Contact ShadeBlade#1198 on Discord to report bugs and problems.

### **New content includes...**
- 33 new badges
- 11 new items
- 55 new maps
- Pit of 100 trials
- Boss rush
- New enemy mechanics
- Changed status mechanics
- New partner (with fully working overworld and battle abilities)
- ~80 new enemies
- Various visual and quality of life changes
- And more!

### Bug Reporting
I've removed bugs I've encountered, but you may find some bugs while playing. In addition to that, badges, enemies and bosses may not be very balanced in this version.
Make sure to contact me if you find bugs or problems, or if you have feedback about unbalanced badges or enemies.
Some rooms may have an unpausing crash (background may be glitched in them) (In rooms affected by this, displaying the badge menu then unpausing will crash. Let me know if you find rooms with this problem)

### Known Bugs
- Goompa can be seen in the partner menu when you have him, but trying to view his moves will crash
- Clefts turn weird colors when attacking (overworld)
- An NPC in the cave area doesn't have the right effects
- Double Dip cost is not completely affected by cost saving badges (This seems to affect only the check for whether you can use it)
- One of the new maps has weird/broken dock physics 

### v0.9.2.1 Changes
- Floor 10 miniboss is no longer RNG based (*Note that the AI can still be hard to predict, but it only acts based on turncount and current HP percentage)
- Floor 90 miniboss is also no longer RNG based
- Master 4 can no longer break save blocks
- Shy Guys' Toybox unpause crashes fixed
- Final boss damage growth has been buffed
- Items now interact with certain special properties enemies can have
- One of the new Shiver Mountain maps has a larger railing to prevent you from falling off
- Huff N Puff no longer sheds 0 puffs from Frigid Stomp and Belly Flop (sidenote: the chill effect normally sets the last damage taken to 0)
- Random timing / sound cue of Tutankoopa's rock attack has been removed (Rock being invisible or not is still random)
- 5th Dark Temple boss should go to its home position as it should
- Chuck Quizmo's final 2 questions are available earlier (this should also make it so that you can't miss the final 2 star pieces)
- One Luigi's Diary entry is available slightly earlier
- Icons for Mario's mail and Luigi's Diary entries are no longer items (Sidenote: The mario wiki said those icons were unused)
- Deathcount on the stat board now displays always (rather than arbitrarily requiring you to use Power Bounce)
- Save block color bug is finally gone

### Balance changes
- Quake Jump costs 16 FP but all 3 hits deal the same damage
- Hustle Spell now costs 14 FP
