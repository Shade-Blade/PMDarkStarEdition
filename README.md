# PMDarkStarEdition
**Paper Mario: Dark Star Edition** is a mod for Paper Mario created by **ShadeBlade** that adds a lot of new content to the game and increases the difficulty.
Some of the content was taken from Master Quest, but most of it is entirely new.
This mod is meant to be about as difficult as Master Quest Jr, but there are badges that increase the health and damage of enemies.

Contact ShadeBlade#1198 on Discord to report bugs and problems.

### **New content includes...**
- 33 new badges
- 7 new items
- 55 new maps
- Pit of 100 trials
- Boss rush
- New enemy mechanics
- Changed status mechanics
- New partner (with fully working overworld and battle abilities)
- ~80 new enemies
- Various visual and quality of life changes
- And more!

### Bug Reporting
I've removed bugs I've encountered, but you may find some bugs while playing. In addition to that, badges, enemies and bosses may not be very balanced in this version.
Make sure to contact me if you find bugs or problems, or if you have feedback about unbalanced badges or enemies.
Some rooms may have an unpausing crash (background may be glitched in them) (In rooms affected by this, displaying the badge menu then unpausing will crash. Let me know if you find rooms with this problem)

### Known Bugs
- Save blocks will not be the right color when you load from save (unpausing will fix this)
- Clefts turn weird colors when attacking
- An NPC in the cave area doesn't have the right effects
- Double Dip cost not completely affected by cost saving badges (this seems to affect only the check for whether you can use it)
- Certain attacks that targets partners are unaffected by dizziness
- One of the new maps has weird/broken dock physics

### v0.9.1.1 Changes
- Shroom Cakes are now sold at the mansion shop (Now Tasty Tonics are harder to obtain)
- Fixed problem with getting the Dark Key
- Lee Bow no longer has the wrong name
- Chapter 6 miniboss has correct tattle
- Badge that requires hitting a tree now requires 8 hits instead of 10
- Tattling the new partner (as an NPC) no longer crashes
