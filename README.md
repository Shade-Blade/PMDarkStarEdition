# PMDarkStarEdition
**Paper Mario: Dark Star Edition** is a mod for Paper Mario created by **ShadeBlade** that adds a lot of new content to the game and increases the difficulty.
Some of the content (various badge and enemy sprites and maps) was taken from Master Quest, but most of it is entirely new.
This mod is meant to be about as difficult as Master Quest Jr, but there are badges that increase the health and damage of enemies.
Thanks to bossbuzz for drawing the partner intro image.

Contact ShadeBlade#1198 on Discord to report bugs and problems.

### **New content includes...**
- 49 new badges
- 49 new items
- Several new mechanics on existing items
- 59 new maps
- Pit of 100 trials
- Boss rushes
- New enemy mechanics
- Changed status mechanics
- 1 new partner (with fully working overworld and battle abilities)
- ~80 new enemies
- Various visual and quality of life changes
- And more!

### Bug Reporting
I've removed bugs I've encountered, but you may find some bugs while playing.
Make sure to contact me if you find bugs or problems, or if you have feedback about unbalanced badges or enemies.
A few rooms may have an unpausing crash (background may be glitched in them) (In rooms affected by this, displaying the badge menu then unpausing will crash. Let me know if you find rooms with this problem)

### Known Bugs
Rare pit crashes
Rare bug where badges near the end of the badge inventory are converted into letters (associated with using many items in battle)

### v1.4.13 Changes 
- Hurricane no longer crashes while enemies with 0 HP are in the battle
- Item Saver now clarifies that it does not work with Life Shroom
- Dark Cake now has a cap of 15 turns (in order to avoid bugs caused by the very hacky way item boosts are coded)
- Small changes to some item descriptions to clarify certain mechanics
- Flower Coins (Greed Stone) BP cost increased (6 -> 8)
- Stellar Coins BP cost decreased (5 -> 4) and starting costs are only 3200x instead of 6400x
- Double Dip BP cost increase (1 -> 2) (Note: the power of items is much higher than in vanilla)
- Triple Dip BP cost increase (3 -> 5)
- Mega Jump FP Cost decrease (9 -> 7)
- Mega Smash FP Cost decrease (9 -> 8)
- Stop Smash FP Cost decrease (6 -> 5)
- Disabled platforms in one of the Dark Temple rooms have the same opacity as in the other rooms (i.e. aren't invisible anymore)
- Source Code updated to v1.4.13
