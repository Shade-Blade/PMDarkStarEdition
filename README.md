# PMDarkStarEdition
**Paper Mario: Dark Star Edition** is a mod for Paper Mario created by **ShadeBlade** that adds a lot of new content to the game and increases the difficulty.
Some of the content was taken from Master Quest, but most of it is entirely new.
This mod is meant to be about as difficult as Master Quest Jr, but there are badges that increase the health and damage of enemies.
Thanks to bossbuzz for drawing the partner intro image.

Contact ShadeBlade#1198 on Discord to report bugs and problems.

### **New content includes...**
- 35 new badges
- 11 new items
- 55 new maps
- Pit of 100 trials
- Boss rush
- New enemy mechanics
- Changed status mechanics
- New partner (with fully working overworld and battle abilities)
- ~80 new enemies
- Various visual and quality of life changes
- And more!

### Bug Reporting
I've removed bugs I've encountered, but you may find some bugs while playing.
Make sure to contact me if you find bugs or problems, or if you have feedback about unbalanced badges or enemies.
A few rooms may have an unpausing crash (background may be glitched in them) (In rooms affected by this, displaying the badge menu then unpausing will crash. Let me know if you find rooms with this problem)

### Known Bugs
- One of the new maps has weird/broken dock physics

### v1.0.1.6 Changes
- Source code link updated to 1.0.1.5
- Buzzar wind attack damage increased by 1 but it is blockable now
- Lantern attack fully misses if Big Lantern Ghost is dizzy
- No longer possible to instakill enemies with exactly 256, 512, etc hp using Curse / Chill Out
- Defense displayer won't try to display -1 (*this bug causes some visual problems)
- Failing the Curse action command actually does something different
