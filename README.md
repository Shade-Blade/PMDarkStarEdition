# PMDarkStarEdition
**Paper Mario: Dark Star Edition** is a mod for Paper Mario created by **ShadeBlade** that adds a lot of new content to the game and increases the difficulty.
Some of the content was taken from Master Quest, but most of it is entirely new.
This mod is meant to be about as difficult as Master Quest Jr, but there are badges that increase the health and damage of enemies.
Thanks to bossbuzz for drawing the partner intro image.

Contact ShadeBlade#1198 on Discord to report bugs and problems.

### **New content includes...**
- 35 new badges
- 11 new items
- 55 new maps
- Pit of 100 trials
- Boss rush
- New enemy mechanics
- Changed status mechanics
- New partner (with fully working overworld and battle abilities)
- ~80 new enemies
- Various visual and quality of life changes
- And more!

### Bug Reporting
I've removed bugs I've encountered, but you may find some bugs while playing.
Make sure to contact me if you find bugs or problems, or if you have feedback about unbalanced badges or enemies.
A few rooms may have an unpausing crash (background may be glitched in them) (In rooms affected by this, displaying the badge menu then unpausing will crash. Let me know if you find rooms with this problem)

### Known Bugs
- One of the new maps has weird/broken dock physics

### v1.0.1.8 Changes
- Fixed the story progress on some Merluvlee fortunes
- No longer possible for Tayce T to cook recipes outside of the recipe table
- Tutankoopa EX summons Golden Chomps (now named correctly) instead of regular chomps
- Crystal King EX shows the correct messages now
- Boss Rush now tracks how many turns you took to beat everything, and there is a sign to go along with that. (If you beat them in previous updates, it will just say "N/A" for turn count)
- EX Rush has been changed so hopefully it is now actually possible
- EX Rush reward's sprite has been fixed
