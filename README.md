# PMDarkStarEdition
**Paper Mario: Dark Star Edition** is a mod for Paper Mario created by **ShadeBlade** that adds a lot of new content to the game and increases the difficulty.
Some of the content (various badge and enemy sprites and maps) was taken from Master Quest, but most of it is entirely new.
This mod is meant to be about as difficult as Master Quest Jr, but there are badges that increase the health and damage of enemies.
Thanks to bossbuzz for drawing the partner intro image.

Contact ShadeBlade#1198 on Discord to report bugs and problems.

### **New content includes...**
- 49 new badges
- 41 new items
- Several new mechanics on existing items
- 59 new maps
- Pit of 100 trials
- Boss rush
- New enemy mechanics
- Changed status mechanics
- New partner (with fully working overworld and battle abilities)
- ~80 new enemies
- Various visual and quality of life changes
- And more!

### Bug Reporting
I've removed bugs I've encountered, but you may find some bugs while playing.
Make sure to contact me if you find bugs or problems, or if you have feedback about unbalanced badges or enemies.
A few rooms may have an unpausing crash (background may be glitched in them) (In rooms affected by this, displaying the badge menu then unpausing will crash. Let me know if you find rooms with this problem)

### Known Bugs

### v1.3.1.3 Changes
- Goomba bros in the rematch fight no longer retain their charge if you use Zap Tap
- Normal fleeing no longer costs 2 fp
- Yoshi Cookie / Yoshi Biscuit effect no longer persists between battles
- Light rush boss 5: certain attacks will no longer crash when Mario is invisible
- Tayce T no longer gives you the all recipes reward at 60 recipes (the pre 1.3 recipe count)
- Feelin Fine and Berserker descriptions are more accurate now
- Happy Heart correctly displays the heart now
- Super Soda correctly removes certain status ailments
- Rearranged one of the Shiver Mountain enemy formations so that first striking makes sense
- Health focus and Flower focus bp cost increased (1 -> 3) but they can now be combined with Group Focus again

v1.3 is more likely to be the final content update. I have a method to create space for more consumable items, but now the question is "Why should I add this?" more than "Can I add this?"
v1.4 will probably be a full game balance update, though I'm not sure how many things actually need balancing
