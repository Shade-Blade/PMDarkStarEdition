# PMDarkStarEdition
**Paper Mario: Dark Star Edition** is a mod for Paper Mario created by **ShadeBlade** that adds a lot of new content to the game and increases the difficulty.
Some of the content (various badge and enemy sprites and maps) was taken from Master Quest, but most of it is entirely new.
This mod is meant to be about as difficult as Master Quest Jr, but there are badges that increase the health and damage of enemies.
Thanks to bossbuzz for drawing the partner intro image.

Contact ShadeBlade#1198 on Discord to report bugs and problems.

### **New content includes...**
- 49 new badges
- 49 new items
- Several new mechanics on existing items
- 59 new maps
- Pit of 100 trials
- Boss rushes
- New enemy mechanics
- Changed status mechanics
- 1 new partner (with fully working overworld and battle abilities)
- ~80 new enemies
- Various visual and quality of life changes
- And more!

### Bug Reporting
I've removed bugs I've encountered, but you may find some bugs while playing.
Make sure to contact me if you find bugs or problems, or if you have feedback about unbalanced badges or enemies.
A few rooms may have an unpausing crash (background may be glitched in them) (In rooms affected by this, displaying the badge menu then unpausing will crash. Let me know if you find rooms with this problem)

### Known Bugs


### v1.4.1.0 Changes
- No longer possible to avoid the fp cost increases caused by invis items
- 1 block in chapter 6 has been unhidden
- Enemy Lakilester will no longer spawn effects that never despawn using Spiny Surge (Sidenote: effect code is wacky)
- Hopefully it is no longer possible for partner to be stunlocked in Light Rush Room 5
- Small visual glitch for one of the bosses in Light Rush Room 5 has been fixed
- Floor 100 and Light Rush Room 5 should no longer crash when you go invisible against certain attacks
- Source code updated to v1.4.1.0 (Sidenote: each source code has a link to the previous version of the source)

1.4 is almost certainly going to be the final major update (no 1.5). There really isn't much else to add at this point. 
(Although, I may decide to make a 2.0 version in the far future that would change almost everything)
