# PMDarkStarEdition
**Paper Mario: Dark Star Edition** is a mod for Paper Mario created by **ShadeBlade** that adds a lot of new content to the game and increases the difficulty.
Some of the content (various badge and enemy sprites and maps) was taken from Master Quest, but most of it is entirely new.
This mod is meant to be about as difficult as Master Quest Jr, but there are badges that increase the health and damage of enemies.
Thanks to bossbuzz for drawing the partner intro image.

Contact ShadeBlade#1198 on Discord to report bugs and problems.

### **New content includes...**
- 49 new badges
- 49 new items
- Several new mechanics on existing items
- 59 new maps
- Pit of 100 trials
- Boss rushes
- New enemy mechanics
- Changed status mechanics
- 1 new partner (with fully working overworld and battle abilities)
- ~80 new enemies
- Various visual and quality of life changes
- And more!

### Bug Reporting
I've removed bugs I've encountered, but you may find some bugs while playing.
Make sure to contact me if you find bugs or problems, or if you have feedback about unbalanced badges or enemies.
A few rooms may have an unpausing crash (background may be glitched in them) (In rooms affected by this, displaying the badge menu then unpausing will crash. Let me know if you find rooms with this problem)

### Known Bugs


### v1.4.0.5 Changes
- Various instances of "Star Energy" have been removed
- Tutankoopa's magic should now work correctly with dizzy
- Lava Piranha's defense should be correct at the start of Phase 2
- Smooch's special effect is now described when you get it (sidenote: if you accidentally define the same string twice, the second one is used)
- Some kooper shell toss oddities should no longer happen
- The Master should now count the hits from fast multihit moves correctly
- Invisibility items now have a new downside
- Changed one Quizmo question that was wrong
- Floor 90 boss's healing move can now only be done 1 time instead of infinite number of times (but it always happens under 10 hp)
- Minor changes to floor 90 boss's effects
- Fixed(??) the badges turning into letters glitch? (though I have never been able to reproduce that bug)
- Toadinator purple form now transitions to yellow form if he doesn't do enough damage
- Toadinator yellow form gains +2 defense instead of just +1 defense per turn
- Dark Shield now works as described (instead of only giving you the benefit at exactly 0 star power)

1.4 is almost certainly going to be the final major update (no 1.5). There really isn't much else to add at this point. 
(Although, I may decide to make a 2.0 version in the far future that would change almost everything)
