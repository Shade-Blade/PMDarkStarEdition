# PMDarkStarEdition
**Paper Mario: Dark Star Edition** is a mod for Paper Mario created by **ShadeBlade** that adds a lot of new content to the game and increases the difficulty.
Some of the content was taken from Master Quest, but most of it is entirely new.
This mod is meant to be about as difficult as Master Quest Jr, but there are badges that increase the health and damage of enemies.

Contact ShadeBlade#1198 on Discord to report bugs and problems.

### **New content includes...**
- 33 new badges
- 7 new items
- 55 new maps
- Pit of 100 trials
- Boss rush
- New enemy mechanics
- Changed status mechanics
- New partner (with fully working overworld and battle abilities)
- ~80 new enemies
- Various visual and quality of life changes
- And more!

### Bug Reporting
I've removed bugs I've encountered, but you may find some bugs while playing. In addition to that, badges, enemies and bosses may not be very balanced in this version.
Make sure to contact me if you find bugs or problems, or if you have feedback about unbalanced badges or enemies.
Some rooms may have an unpausing crash (caused by a lack of a background) (In rooms affected by this, displaying the badge menu then unpausing will crash. Let me know if rooms have this problem)

### Known Bugs
- Save blocks will not be the right color when you load from save (unpausing will fix this)
- Clefts turn weird colors when attacking
- An NPC in the cave area doesn't have the right effects
- Major bug: If you enter the fight with Master 4 and then load a savestate outside, save blocks will no longer function correctly (Getting a game over or reloading the file will work properly)


### v0.9.0.3 Changes
- Frigid Stomp is no longer broken
- It should no longer be possible to go around Robotoad (Note: The cave will have no enemies in it before chapter 8 to prevent easy grinding)
- Ruined city center has different tattle before the bridge is activated (original one is kind of misleading)
- Pit rest floor fights should no longer fight immediately after entering the room
- Remedy Guy and Practitioner Guy tattles are fixed
- Mega Rush encounter no longer crashes
- Floor 21 and Floor 22 of the Pit now have Red Goombas instead of Monty Moles
