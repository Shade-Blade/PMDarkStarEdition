# PMDarkStarEdition
**Paper Mario: Dark Star Edition** is a mod for Paper Mario created by **ShadeBlade** that adds a lot of new content to the game and increases the difficulty.
Some of the content was taken from Master Quest, but most of it is entirely new.
This mod is meant to be about as difficult as Master Quest Jr, but there are badges that increase the health and damage of enemies.
Thanks to bossbuzz for drawing the partner intro image.

Contact ShadeBlade#1198 on Discord to report bugs and problems.

### **New content includes...**
- 35 new badges
- 11 new items
- 55 new maps
- Pit of 100 trials
- Boss rush
- New enemy mechanics
- Changed status mechanics
- New partner (with fully working overworld and battle abilities)
- ~80 new enemies
- Various visual and quality of life changes
- And more!

### Bug Reporting
I've removed bugs I've encountered, but you may find some bugs while playing.
Make sure to contact me if you find bugs or problems, or if you have feedback about unbalanced badges or enemies.
A few rooms may have an unpausing crash (background may be glitched in them) (In rooms affected by this, displaying the badge menu then unpausing will crash. Let me know if you find rooms with this problem)

### Known Bugs
- One of the new maps has weird/broken dock physics

### v1.0.2.0 Changes
- Chapter 1 Bobuke no longer has a different defense table than the others
- Boss Rush now correctly counts the turns for the last battle in the rush
- Some Rowf badges rearranged
- If you end the Chapter 6 Peach intermission without dropping off all of Peach's items, they should be automatically be put in the chest anyway
- Goomnuts and Nutty Cakes have new effects
- In the Koopa Bros EX fight, the dizzy effect on Mario now lasts 2 turns
- Crystal King clones are slightly easier to distinguish from the original
- Incorrect defense with Dark Temple boss 6 should be gone
- Robotoad is now closer to the pipe. This should prevent all skip bugs since you can no longer access the pipe without being inside his trigger radius
- Source Code link updated to v1.0.2.0
