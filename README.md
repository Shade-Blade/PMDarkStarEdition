# PMDarkStarEdition
**Paper Mario: Dark Star Edition** is a mod for Paper Mario created by **ShadeBlade** that adds a lot of new content to the game and increases the difficulty.
Some of the content (various badge and enemy sprites and maps) was taken from Master Quest, but most of it is entirely new.
This mod is meant to be about as difficult as Master Quest Jr, but there are badges that increase the health and damage of enemies.
Thanks to bossbuzz for drawing the partner intro image.

Contact ShadeBlade#1198 on Discord to report bugs and problems.

### **New content includes...**
- 49 new badges
- 18 new items
- Several new mechanics on existing items
- 59 new maps
- Pit of 100 trials
- Boss rush
- New enemy mechanics
- Changed status mechanics
- New partner (with fully working overworld and battle abilities)
- ~80 new enemies
- Various visual and quality of life changes
- And more!

### Bug Reporting
I've removed bugs I've encountered, but you may find some bugs while playing.
Make sure to contact me if you find bugs or problems, or if you have feedback about unbalanced badges or enemies.
A few rooms may have an unpausing crash (background may be glitched in them) (In rooms affected by this, displaying the badge menu then unpausing will crash. Let me know if you find rooms with this problem)

### Known Bugs
- Damage effects for Power Bomb do not display correctly

### v1.2.0.0 Changes
- Super Soda and Tasty Tonic now cure stat downs
- Changed 2 Quizmo questions
- Up and Away is now deterministic (though the way it works now is hard to explain)
- A few new maps added to the new cave area. The 128th badge is locked behind a short boss fight.
- Golden Shroom no longer crashes when used in battle
- Slight modification to the animations of the pit floor 100 boss
- Wording of some badge fortunes has been fixed
- It should no longer be possible for partner to be stunlocked in Light Rush fight 5
- Source code updated to v1.2.0.0
- Item and badge shops should really be fixed (?)

- Static Stomp is 1 BP now
- Curse badges now talk about coin gain
- Focus badges now talk about their interaction with Deep Focus.
- Stellar Burst no longer changes the colors of the Star Power costs when the conditions aren't met

- Various formations have been changed to make it much more difficult to farm star points off of cursed enemies
- Tutankoopa now flies up before activating the new curses
- Tutankoopa can now move after doing new curses

This will probably be the last major content update since there is no more space for more badges or items (Mario can't have more than 128 badges at a time)
