# PMDarkStarEdition
**Paper Mario: Dark Star Edition** is a mod for Paper Mario created by **ShadeBlade** that adds a lot of new content to the game and increases the difficulty.
Some of the content (various badge and enemy sprites and maps) was taken from Master Quest, but most of it is entirely new.
This mod is meant to be about as difficult as Master Quest Jr, but there are badges that increase the health and damage of enemies.
Thanks to bossbuzz for drawing the partner intro image.

Contact ShadeBlade#1198 on Discord to report bugs and problems.

### **New content includes...**
- 49 new badges
- 41 new items
- Several new mechanics on existing items
- 59 new maps
- Pit of 100 trials
- Boss rush
- New enemy mechanics
- Changed status mechanics
- New partner (with fully working overworld and battle abilities)
- ~80 new enemies
- Various visual and quality of life changes
- And more!

### Bug Reporting
I've removed bugs I've encountered, but you may find some bugs while playing.
Make sure to contact me if you find bugs or problems, or if you have feedback about unbalanced badges or enemies.
A few rooms may have an unpausing crash (background may be glitched in them) (In rooms affected by this, displaying the badge menu then unpausing will crash. Let me know if you find rooms with this problem)

### Known Bugs

### v1.3.0.0 Changes
- Tattling the early version of a chapter 7 encounter no longer gives an error message
- Refund now turns into Item Finder when you have Greed Stone
- Recoil throw has been nerfed (cost 6 FP -> 7 FP, damage nerfed to be in line for mega smash)
- Delayed heal items no longer stack in strange ways (using items with different powers now works as expected)
- Fixed damage effects from Power Bomb
- In the Koopa Bros rematch, you can flip the koopa bros correctly again
- Double Dip now properly works with Flower Health
- New Stinky Herb effect
- Mega Bolt description has been fixed
- Dark Rush now has 8 battles (now all of the Dark Temple bosses are there)
- Source Code link updated to 1.3.0.0

New Items / Item Changes
- You can now use the 9 Peach baking items as Mario (though most of their effects are in other items too)
- 	(Note: this could cause bugs with the peach baking sequence but it probably won't)
- Super Shroom in Yoshi's Village shop has been replaced with a Strawberry
- 12 new item recipes
- 2 new non-recipe items available in the Shiver City shop and Bowser's Castle shop

Non-changes (Things that you should keep an eye out on to see if there are bugs)
- All the big chests (super boots, ultra boots, etc) have been changed internally. This shouldn't change anything but keep on the look out for bugs
- The dojo items (degree cards) have been changed internally also.
- Boo's Mansion items and Sneaky Parasol have been changed internally also.
- Some flags on the Peach baking items have been altered, but I think the baking sequence should still work correctly.
- The code for how all the special effect items work (attack, defense and fp saver boosts) has been internally changed

v1.3 is more likely to be the final content update. I have a method to create space for more consumable items, but now the question is "Why should I add this?" more than "Can I add this?"
