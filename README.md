# PMDarkStarEdition
**Paper Mario: Dark Star Edition** is a mod for Paper Mario created by **ShadeBlade** that adds a lot of new content to the game and increases the difficulty.
Some of the content (various badge and enemy sprites and maps) was taken from Master Quest, but most of it is entirely new.
This mod is meant to be about as difficult as Master Quest Jr, but there are badges that increase the health and damage of enemies.
Thanks to bossbuzz for drawing the partner intro image.

Contact ShadeBlade#1198 on Discord to report bugs and problems.

### **New content includes...**
- 49 new badges
- 49 new items
- Several new mechanics on existing items
- 59 new maps
- Pit of 100 trials
- Boss rushes
- New enemy mechanics
- Changed status mechanics
- 1 new partner (with fully working overworld and battle abilities)
- ~80 new enemies
- Various visual and quality of life changes
- And more!

### Bug Reporting
I've removed bugs I've encountered, but you may find some bugs while playing.
Make sure to contact me if you find bugs or problems, or if you have feedback about unbalanced badges or enemies.
A few rooms may have an unpausing crash (background may be glitched in them) (In rooms affected by this, displaying the badge menu then unpausing will crash. Let me know if you find rooms with this problem)

### Known Bugs


### v1.4.1.1 Changes
- Cheep cheep defense table changed slightly (no immunity to water)
- Red Paragoombas are now correctly weak to throw
- Chapter 1 Bobuke no longer crashes if you use Flame Smash on it (but why would you do that?)
- Kent C Koopa no longer hits the partner when he is dizzy (sidenote: dizzy hits use the lucky hit code, and partners normally don't get lucky)
- Stop Smash now inflicts stop for 4 turns
- Turn count no longer overflows if a battle takes hundreds of turns (though now it will jump from 120 to 61 instead of going to 121)
- Softlock problem with a fight outside of Bowser's Castle should be fixed
- Red Bones are now correctly immune to fire
- Robotoad (and Toadinator) yellow form should no longer stunlock your partner
- Toadinator yellow form's attacks are electrical element now
- Tradeoff Shake now works correctly when buff turn count is higher than 7

1.4 is almost certainly going to be the final major update (no 1.5). There really isn't much else to add at this point. 
(Although, I may decide to make a 2.0 version in the far future that would change almost everything)
