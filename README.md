# PMDarkStarEdition
**Paper Mario: Dark Star Edition** is a mod for Paper Mario created by **ShadeBlade** that adds a lot of new content to the game and increases the difficulty.
Some of the content (various badge and enemy sprites and maps) was taken from Master Quest, but most of it is entirely new.
This mod is meant to be about as difficult as Master Quest Jr, but there are badges that increase the health and damage of enemies.
Thanks to bossbuzz for drawing the partner intro image.

Contact ShadeBlade#1198 on Discord to report bugs and problems.

### **New content includes...**
- 49 new badges
- 18 new items
- Several new mechanics on existing items
- 59 new maps
- Pit of 100 trials
- Boss rush
- New enemy mechanics
- Changed status mechanics
- New partner (with fully working overworld and battle abilities)
- ~80 new enemies
- Various visual and quality of life changes
- And more!

### Bug Reporting
I've removed bugs I've encountered, but you may find some bugs while playing.
Make sure to contact me if you find bugs or problems, or if you have feedback about unbalanced badges or enemies.
A few rooms may have an unpausing crash (background may be glitched in them) (In rooms affected by this, displaying the badge menu then unpausing will crash. Let me know if you find rooms with this problem)

### Known Bugs
- Damage effects for Power Bomb do not display correctly

### v1.2.1.0 Changes
- No longer possible to have more Star Power than the maximum (For real this time)
- Flower Health no longer weakens HP Drain effects
- HP Drain turns into FP Drain if you have the Greed Stone
- HP Drain can now be used in Danger
- HP Drain restoration is capped to 5 per turn correctly
- You no longer get Smooch's effect permanently for free
- Fixed problems with Happy Heart / Happy Flower and certain environmental effects

v1.2 will probably be the last major content update since there is no more space for more badges or items (Mario can't have more than 128 badges at a time)
