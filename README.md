# PMDarkStarEdition
**Paper Mario: Dark Star Edition** is a mod for Paper Mario created by **ShadeBlade** that adds a lot of new content to the game and increases the difficulty.
Some of the content was taken from Master Quest, but most of it is entirely new.
This mod is meant to be about as difficult as Master Quest Jr, but there are badges that increase the health and damage of enemies.
Thanks to bossbuzz for drawing the partner intro image.

Contact ShadeBlade#1198 on Discord to report bugs and problems.

### **New content includes...**
- 33 new badges
- 11 new items
- 55 new maps
- Pit of 100 trials
- Boss rush
- New enemy mechanics
- Changed status mechanics
- New partner (with fully working overworld and battle abilities)
- ~80 new enemies
- Various visual and quality of life changes
- And more!

### Bug Reporting
I've removed bugs I've encountered, but you may find some bugs while playing. In addition to that, badges, enemies and bosses may not be very balanced in this version.
Make sure to contact me if you find bugs or problems, or if you have feedback about unbalanced badges or enemies.
Some rooms may have an unpausing crash (background may be glitched in them) (In rooms affected by this, displaying the badge menu then unpausing will crash. Let me know if you find rooms with this problem)

### Known Bugs
- Save blocks will not be the right color when you load from save (unpausing will fix this)
- Goompa can be seen in the partner menu when you have him, but trying to view his moves will crash
- Clefts turn weird colors when attacking (overworld)
- An NPC in the cave area doesn't have the right effects
- Double Dip cost is not completely affected by cost saving badges (This seems to affect only the check for whether you can use it)
- Certain attacks that targets partners are unaffected by dizziness
- One of the new maps has weird/broken dock physics 

### v0.9.2.0 Changes
- Partner targetting moves now (always) miss when the enemy is dizzy
- With 20 items, throwing items from your inventory should no longer destroy another item in addition to the item you chose (Note: Most of the 20 item code does not change based on whether you have 10 or 20 items)
- New mushrooms can now be selected for cooking (But there are no recipes for them, so this really doesn't change much)
- (Chapter 7) Room with invisible blocks no longer has invisible lava (Now you can't use Lakilester to go out of bounds in this room)
- Parakarry's base move's special effect should be more clear now
- Mario sleep now heals 10% of his max hp instead of 20% (with a minimum of 2 hp per turn)
- Kooky Cookie no longer crashes when used
- Chapter 7 fake Bombettes now have correct speaking animations
- Albino Dinos should no longer spawn persistent effects when hit with zap tap
- Giving healing items to a Chapter 8 NPC should work properly
- Master 4 can no longer be stunlocked if you somehow do more than 50 damage per turn
- Chapter 1 Bobuke level lowered to discourage early grinding (27 -> 12)
- Placeholder partner image is gone (Thanks to bossbuzz)
- A lot of the Dark Temple enemies now drop new items (1 new recipe uses them)

### Balance Changes
- Jr Troopa fight in Chapter 8 has been massively nerfed (damage wise)
- Buzzar has been buffed slightly
- Flower Health BP cost has been lowered (6 -> 4)

### New Content
- Several recipe items now have new special effects. List of changed items: (Lemon Candy, Lime Candy, Honey Candy, Iced Potato, Frozen Fries, Koopa Tea) These might need to be balanced later
- 4 new items have been added (Big mistake, dark shroom, dark leaf, leaf shroom)
- Note: item attack and defense boosts / reductions overwrite each other.
